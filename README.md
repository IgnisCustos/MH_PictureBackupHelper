# MH_PictureBackupHelper
Due to the lack of the option to download saved pictures by the stored name from the MyHeritage Website, this little HelperTool was created.

##### Usage: java -jar MHPictureDownloader.jar [input GEDCOM file path] [output path] [boolean download mode]
  - [input GEDCOM file path] : define the full path to your input GEDCOM file
  - [output path] : define the full path were your photos should be saved (Folder will be created if not existent)
  - [boolean download mode] :     {true} --> Photos will be downloaded  {false} --> See how the program would behave, no files will be downloaded\n")

EXAMPLE: java -jar MHPictureDownloader.jar C:\\\\temp\\gedcom_testfile.txt C:\\\\temp\\pics true"
